Hi Professor,

Hope you are doing well.

This is a short summary of what I was able to do with this project.
I had build a personal website to showcase some of my skills (artistic, design work, etc.)
I wanted to use this site as a means of communicating to the public that I would one day be available for commission work.
There are various pages describing some of my hobbies. The about me page includes my resume, email, and some of my social media links.

But of course this project is supposed to be a business, not just a showcase.
Which is why, for the purpose of this project, I attempted to implement a database and a table that could store commission tickets, to gather general information about a commissioner and what they would like to commission.
The code runs and technically works, you can see the input being made to the tickets database in **tbl_commtickets.png**, however I could not get it do display on **commish_ticket.php** properly.

Realistically, if people wanted to commission me, they would just send an email or contact me some other way.
And I would put out some type of post on some social media site saying that I'm open for commissions with my commission sheet available for the public.
From the various artists' sites I've looked into, most do not have any kind of account creation function or commission ticket creation.
The sites are simply there to showcase artwork, and available venues for purchasing content.
If you want to purchase their artwork, it is usually available from third-party sites like Gumroad, Itch.io, with payment methods like Paypal.

After following various artists for years now, I see now that doing this type of work is a hell of a lot to ask of one person.
But freelance work is something I've wanted to get into for a while as a side business, because I'm alright at it.

It's been a pleasure being in your class and hearing your various real-life stories. Have a good winter break.

I wasn't sure how much to put into the business plan, as there wasn't even a requirement for it anywhere on the syllabus, but I made one anyway, hope that's okay.
